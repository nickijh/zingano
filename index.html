		<p class="lead">The biggest badass in Denver crumbles in the corner of the room where she’s hiding.</p>
		<p>And now she’s numb, not unlike the fateful day. Tears pour out like blood. A stranger saunters into the gym locker room, spots her fellow female and coos &mdash; <i>it's OK, it's OK</i>.</p>

<!-- BODY -->
		<p>"And I'm thinking, 'IT'S NOT OK!'" Cat Zingano recalled. "She didn't fight, she doesn't know what I'm doing. All she sees is me crying. Clearly she was trying to be helpful, but I needed her to go away, now. So I just said, 'Thank you' and put my head against the wall."</p>
		<p>This is what happens when you pour your everything into something. When you push your body to a limit it’s not supposed to physically go, while complementing this lunacy with psychological punishment that hurts more than an axe kick to the face.</p>
		<p>"Being hard on yourself," Zingano said, "keeps you safe."</p>
		<p>It’s Jan. 14, one year and one day after the incident. It’s Jan. 14, and she’s fighting. Fighting demons. Fighting for the fight.</p>
		<p>The fight is this Saturday, when Denver’s Zingano, 32, competes for the Ultimate Fighting Championship women’s bantamweight title. It’s the headline bout on a pay-per-view card at Staples Center in Los Angeles. Maybe you don’t know of Cat Zingano. But maybe you’ve heard of her opponent, Ronda Rousey, the reigning champ who’s in action movies, commercials and, most recently, the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.</p>
		<p>Zingano’s journey, from wrestling at Fairview High School to a UFC title shot, has been both rocky and “Rocky.” In her corner on fight night, Cat will have two coaches and two close friends. But the man who should be in her corner is why she’s crumbling in the corner this January night at the gym.</p>
		<p>"Sometimes I have to break," Zingano said. "But I won't stay broken."</p>

		<p>Mauricio Zingano gave her a quick kiss and a bro hug.</p>
		<p>It’s April 13, 2013, and Cat's fight will hardly be a cat fight &mdash; it will be a massacre in mascara.</p>
		<p>Her husband and coach stood behind her, his shaved head bobbing to the beat of pre-fight music, while Cat’s cut man lathered Vaseline on her face.</p>
		<p>An accomplished Brazilian jiu jitsu coach, Mauricio guided Cat’s transformation from wrestler to mixed martial artist, out of the gym they co-owned in Broomfield. And here they were, in Las Vegas, for her biggest fight yet.</p>
		<p>As she walked into the frenzied venue, leading her team's procession to the cage, Zingano started sobbing, swelling her face. A national TV audience tweeted about her tears. Crying before a fight? They must have wondered if Zingano was in over her head, lost in deep waters before the fight even began.</p>
		<p>But she’s unabashedly emotional. Raw and real.</p>
		<p>"It's like "Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, it's about to start,' Zingano said of her pre-fight swing of emotions. "But once that door is closed and you're in there, it's like &mdash; screw it, you've gotta go, now."</p>
		<p>Zingano had been in this position before. In seven previous professional fights, she rarely wavered and never lost. Only once did an opponent even survive to a decision, when Zingano unanimously topped Barb Honchak, back in 2010.</p>
		<p>As Cat approached the octagon in Vegas, she fed off Mauricio and her other coaches, peppering her with pre-fight positivity.</p>
		<p>But when the cage door closes behind you, you're all alone.</p>

		</div>

		<p>“What’s up, stud!” Zingano’s coach, Leister Bowling, exclaimed to Brayden Zingano.</p>
		<p>An hour before her Jan. 14 breakdown, Cat unassumingly entered MusclePharm gym in the Montbello neighborhood of Denver, greeted by a family of fighters of all shapes and sizes, many with cauliflower ears, tattoos crawling down their arms and T-Shirts screaming outrageous mantras (“FIGHTING IS IN MY DNA”). She’s the only athlete on the mats who brought a child, her bubbly son Brayden, age 8.</p>
		<p>Within minutes, Brayden was inside the black-wired octagon, playfully sparring a professional fighter, twice Brayden’s height. The boy sported fighting gloves so oversized, they would’ve been more suited for his dad.</p>
		<p>At MusclePharm, it’s as if everyone here is Brayden’s fun uncle. Really though, that’s not a stretch.</p>
		<p>Later, while Brayden was swinging on nearby gymnast rings, a sparring partner was slamming his mom around a cage. It was bad. Zingano fought sloppy and slow. Somewhere, Rousey was surely having a better session, one day closer to the big fight. When Zingano’s four five-minute practice rounds ended, she escaped to the women’s locker room, crumbling in the corner.</p>
		<p>About 45 minutes later, she remerged and sat on a bench near the octagon -- her eyes weathered and red, impenetrable. A jovial guest tried to get her to loosen up, but she wasn’t going to let an outsider see inside her. Soon, Cat’s friend and fellow fighter, Brandon Thatch, began rubbing her shoulders.</p>
		<p>"I love you, you know we all love you,” he told her.</p>
		<p>Love. This word grapples the fighter.</p>
		<p>Sure, she knows how to love love. Her son is her life, and she loves her sport and her support. She also knows how to love hate. She embraces the vitriol necessary to make a poor woman’s face the color of an eggplant. But love took her for a ride. Can she teach herself to trust love again, as if it’s something to be learned, like fighting techniques?</p>
		<p>“When it all comes down to it, he had my heart, all wrapped up.” Zingano said one day recently, while Sam Smith’s song “Stay With Me” faintly played in the background. “I never felt like that about anybody. And I don’t imagine feeling like that about anybody again.”</p>

		<p>Miesha Tate. She awaited Cat that 2013 night in Vegas, as Mauricio peered from outside the octagon. Tate, a former champion in the Strikeforce series. Tate, an overwhelming favorite.</p>
		<p>And there was more on the line than a shiny belt. Zingano vs. Tate was an elimination bout -- the winner would earn a title shot against Rousey in the first UFC women's championship. It also meant a fat TV contract to coach a team in season 18 of “The Ultimate Fighter,” the UFC's reality TV competition show.</p>
		<p>One of the women would get a big career break. So, who would break first?</p>
		<p>Tate sprinted out when the horn sounded, grabbed Zingano around the waist and, just five seconds in, slammed Cat to the mat.</p>
		<p>Zingano was 14 when she started wrestling in middle school. The only girl. At Fairview High in Boulder, Zingano wrestled at 130 and 135 pounds. Her parents hated the idea.</p>
		<p>"I identified with it,” she said. “I loved it."</p>
		<p>She devoured the sport. She showed up at gyms looking to learn. She pushed her way into a practice session at nearby Lyons High, where some of the best prep wrestlers were holding court.</p>
		<p>Leister Bowling, on his way to becoming a three-time Colorado champion at Lyons, was already well known in wrestling circles. And he didn't want Zingano anywhere near his mats. This was a boy’s club. In a practice session, he intentionally shattered her cheekbone.</p>
		<p>"He tried to make me quit all the time," Zingano said of the man who, sure enough, would one day become one of her coaches. "He and his teammate were the two best in the room, and I asked if I could go with them. And they’re like, ‘Oh this chick thinks she’s going to go with us? She’s never going to wrestle again after this.’" </p>
		<p>Cat came back the next day.</p>
		<p>“I got beat up a lot,” she said, “but it made me really tough."</p>
		<p>In Vegas, with her back to the mat under Tate's barrage, Zingano wriggled away. She slipped a perfect escape to regain her feet. Within a minute, Zingano then gained control. She folded Tate's head under the crook of her elbow, working toward a guillotine choke, with all her leverage in the legs &mdash; a tenet of wrestling.</p>
		<p>Wrestling put Zingano on a path. Her grades in high school jumped and she graduated from Fairview in 2001. She went to NAIA Cumberland (Tenn.) College to wrestle, later transferring to Division III MacMurray (Ill.). She wanted to wrestle her way to the Athens Olympics in 2004.</p>
		<p>But when she was a freshman at Cumberland, one of Zingano's closest friends, a 17-year-old named Mary Rogers, was found tortured and killed in Westminster. Rogers' boyfriend was later convicted of first-degree murder.</p>
		<p>"At the time, I don’t feel like I recovered from that," Zingano said of her time in college in the early 2000s. "She was one of my best friends since I was 8 years old. It was just really traumatic. Now I look back and I just feel -- a lot of my drive for what I wanted to do with wrestling was smoldered by that."</p>
		<p>But in 2007, on a recommendation, she walked into Zingano's Brazilian jiu jitsu gym in Broomfield, discovering a new challenge.</p>

		<p>It was love at first fight.</p>
		<p>Zingano entered the gym, and there was this instructor. Mauricio.</p>
		<p>“I was in awe of him, how strong he was, how talented he was,” Cat said. “The presence he carried, he was just so bold and impressive. And he really made me laugh a lot.”</p>
		<p>He suggested she take a jiu jitsu class. She promptly fell in love -- with the sport and with the instructor.</p>
		<p>One day on a gym trip at Water World, Cat recalled in a soft voice, “He held my hand.” Though she was wary of dating her coach, these feelings were new and exciting and raw.</p>
		<p>“Finally, I went back to a class,” she said, “And he said, ‘All right, you and me are (sparring)!’ After class, he pulled me aside, and we were connected at the hip after. Always, forever.</p>
		<p>“At first, it was perfect. I was so gung-ho on impressing him, being his prodigy, winning every tournament. Everything I did, I wanted to keep handing him trophies -- this is for you, I won this. I felt like I couldn’t do any wrong, and he was so proud of me.”</p>
		<p>They became addicted. Addicted to each other. Addicted to success. In the beginning, the addiction was deemed a harmless positive -- work hard, fight ward, win hard. But the dynamic was disastrous. See, her boyfriend, ultimately her husband, was her coach too. And her business partner &mdash; they owned multiple gyms. Oh, and they were parents.</p>
		<p>Her husband saw greatness in her fists, and constantly challenged her to eat certain foods, to go for an extra run at night, to learn from criticism at all hours.</p>
		<p>“I didn’t know who I was talking to,” she said. “I had so much respect for him, I would never say anything. I would look at him as my coach and my boss, but I needed to be able to talk to him like my husband.”</p>
		<p>She kept winning, though. Perhaps that was the worst thing that could have happened. The addiction became insatiable.</p>
		<p>“There was depression,” she said of Mauricio. “I feel like we would’ve figured it out eventually, but he made some bad choices to make things worse, and I couldn’t put up with it and have my son around it. He got scary. I had to do something, but I didn’t know what to do.</p>
		<p>“So I left him.”</p>

		</div>

		<p>Tate wriggled out of the guillotine. She flung a rigid jab that landed on Zingano's chin, stunning Cat and backing her to the cage. Tate would land 23 significant strikes in the fight, 21 at Zingano's head.</p>
		<p>But she weathered Tate's blows and grew more aggressive as the bout wore on. This was her great trait -- hit me and I’ll hit you harder.</p>
		<p>Professional prize fighting is a little like trying to solve a math equation while someone pitches baseballs at your face. In order to survive, let alone be successful, fighters have to keep their wits under extreme stress, in order to perform a set of specific, directed movements.</p>
		<p>More than other sports, the fight game is about mastering your own body. Fighting, Joyce Carol Oates once wrote about boxing, "is about being hit rather more than it is about hitting, just as it is about feeling pain, if not devastating psychological paralysis, more than it is about winning."</p>
		<p>Zingano's own introduction to MMA was brutal. It was a lesson, if you want to call it that, from Mauricio. He told her she’d be a champion one day, but it would be earned.</p>
		<p>"He stood me in the corner of a boxing ring and just teed off on me, on my face, everything," she said.  "He was trying to teach me to not turn when I was being hit. Because I don't like getting hit, like a regular human. I would be crying, balling. He had another student doing it to me too. And then they would tell me when to shoot -- and I would go for a takedown right away so they'd stop hitting me.</p>
		<p>"I yelled, 'Stop hitting me!' It happens every fight. Nobody likes getting hit. I don't. But when somebody gets a good one off on me, it makes me really mad. I just want to make it stop. I want to punish them.”</p>
		<p>Tate was about to be punished.</p>

		<p>Now living apart, the Zinganos agreed to meet at the play area at FlatIrons Mall in Broomfield. It was January of 2014. They could share some quality Brayden time. A chance to be a family again.</p>
		<p>He never showed.</p>
		<p>She called. She called again. Mauricio never missed a meet-up with Brayden. She called again. Where is this guy? She drove to his home, saw his car out front.</p>
		<p>“I was afraid to go in,” she said, “because I didn’t know what that meant I was going to find.”</p>
		<p>Each time she dialed his number, there was a simultaneous feeling of hope and hopelessness. Just answer and everything will be all right, right?</p>
		<p>The following day, she asked one of their jiu jitsu students to go by Mauricio’s home. But the student never called Cat back. So Cat finally went to the house.</p>
		<p>Cop cars.</p>
		<p><i>What did he do?</i></p>
		<p>Did he have a dispute with the student? This had to be a bad dream.</p>
		<p><i>Wake up! Everything will be OK!</i></p>
		<p>“Are you Cat?” a detective asked her.</p>
		<p>She didn’t know what to say. Should she call a lawyer? Mauricio always said to opt for a lawyer instead of talking to cops.</p>
		<p>“I can only tell you what happened if you’re Cat,” the detective said.</p>
		<p>Looking back at that moment, Cat recalled how she didn’t realize she was screaming, as if she wasn’t in control of her body.</p>
		<p>But she was indeed screaming, incessantly, the same three words, over and over: “WHAT THE F---? WHAT THE F---? WHAT THE F---?”</p>
		<p>Mauricio was dead. Suicide. Age 37.</p>

		<p>When she won the biggest fight of her life, Cat screamed “I love you Brayden!” into a camera lens, while her husband lifted her like a trophy.</p>
		<p>Cat unleashed a primal scream and one final punch into the air, while Mauricio shouted “F---ing No. 1!” with his wife in his arms.</p>
		<p>Cat defeated Tate that 2013 night in Vegas with a hard-to-watch sequence of four consecutive knees to the face. Cat held Tate’s head in a vice move the whole time. Fight over. TKO 2:55, third round.</p>
		<p>It was all happening.</p>
		<p>If she could have only known what would happen.</p>
		<p>As she trained to fight Rousey, Cat tore the ACL in her left knee. They canceled Cat’s title shot. They canceled Cat’s role on the reality TV show. And of all people, they gave Tate her place in the fight and the show.</p>
		<p>And Mauricio’s downward spiral began.</p>

		<p>How do you tell a boy his dad is dead?</p>
		<p>Cat opened the bedroom door that 2014 night, and there was her innocent child, oblivious in bed.</p>
		<p>This image. Heart-wrenching.</p>
		<p>“I got home that night,” Cat said, uncharacteristically clearing her throat, “and Brayden was asleep. I had to wake him up. I feel like every catastrophe in our lives, you remember exactly where you were, what you were doing, who you were with, almost down to what you were wearing. I get one shot at this.”</p>
		<p>The detective told her to speak definitively, to avoid ambiguity. Trying to soften the moment only makes it worse.</p>
		<p>He’s dead. Gone. Dad is gone.</p>
		<p>“That,” she recalled, “was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.”</p>
		<p>How do you teach a boy to cope with death, when you don’t know either?</p>
		<p>This is more overwhelming than any Rousey punch.</p>
		<p>Cat and Brayden often visit Judi’s House, meeting with a group of people who also lost a loved one to suicide. Founded by former Broncos quarterback Brian Griese, who lost his mother when he was 12, Judi’s House is a haven for grieving kids, so they don’t have to feel alone.</p>
		<p>Alone. A haunting theme in Cat’s life too. Alone in the ring. Alone as a parent. Alone as a wife. A widow. She’s often surrounded &mdash; by fans and coaches and Brayden and friends &mdash; but she can’t always cover herself from emotions. They’re undefeated. Emotions send her into the corner of the women’s locker room, where she has to hide, suffocated by tears and fear.</p>
		<p>“Catch me any time of the day, I’m either pissed at him, happy with him, in love with him, mad at him,” Cat said of Mauricio, who she still refers to as “my husband” in conversations.</p>
		<p>“I want to go and accomplish and get all of this (fighting success) for us, and everything that we’ve done, and all the work we’ve put into it. He lost his damn mind. And that sucks, because he was a very strong, very smart, very intense and awesome person. But those things, mixed with a crazy ego, destroyed him. It’s bittersweet.</p>
		<p>“For my son to lose his dad and in that kind of way, I don’t know how to put this, but &mdash; I don’t want to quit, because I don’t want that to be embedded in him from more than one angle.”</p>

				</div>

		</div>

		<p>Now Brayden is hiding. It's a February night at MusclePharm gym, and he's crouching inside a giant tractor tire, the kind they make weight-lifters turn over and over as a cruel drill. He's playing hide-and-seek. A woman looks for him, and soon, other fighters join in the playful search.</p>
		<p>The obvious hiding spot is under the cage, where his mom, in padded headgear, is sparring through a training session. After recovering from the knee injury, Cat finally got her shot at Rousey -- a chance to bloody the female face of the UFC on the last day of February. The cage here, really, is a stage, and underneath is a space a few feet high, covered by a curtain. Someone flips up the curtain -- he's gotta be under here, right? -- but he's not. Where'd Brayden go?</p>
		<p>Finally, he pops out of the giant tire, and he flashes a mischievous smile.</p>
		<p>This gym, this community, is his comfort zone. Mom's too. Here, you can be alone in the tire, or alone in the cage, but you never really are alone.</p>
		<p>"To be honest,” Cat said, “I think part of the connection with Brayden and all of my teammates is that every fighter &mdash; some will tell you about it, some won’t &mdash; has gone through hell at some point in their life.</p>
		<p>"With Brayden, they all know what happened, and they see a kid that is going through something -- and whatever color it is of what they’ve gone through, they can identify with him, and they want to be there for him. It’s really sweet. And it’s really cool and comforting.</p>
		<p>"And I don’t know a single fighter who doesn’t have some kind of pain that they’ve dealt with."</p>
