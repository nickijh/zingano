		<p>The toughest woman in Denver runs and hides in a far corner of a gym locker room. She crumbles. Tears pour out like blood.</p>
		<p>It&rsquo;s Jan. 14, one year and one day after the worst day of Cat Zingano&rsquo;s life. She&rsquo;s preparing for what could be one of the best days of her life, when she contends for the Ultimate Fighting Championshiptitle. But she&rsquo;s suffocated by emotions &mdash; of loved ones lost &mdash; and she&rsquo;s lost in a sparring session, fighting sloppily and slowly. She&rsquo;s not herself today, so she hides.</p>
		<p>A stranger saunters in, spots her curled up and crying, and says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK, it&rsquo;s OK.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m thinking, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not  OK!&rsquo;&rdquo; recalled Zingano, a professional mixed martial artist. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t fight, she doesn&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m doing. All she sees is me crying. Clearly she was trying to be helpful, but I needed her to go away, now. So I just said &lsquo;Thank you&rsquo; and put my head against the wall.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>On Saturday night, the 32-year-old Zingano (9-0) will compete for the UFC women&rsquo;s bantamweight title, the headline bout on a pay-per-view card at Staples Center in Los Angeles. Her opponent, reigning champ Ronda Rousey (10-0), is an Olympic bronze medalist in judo and a star of action movies. She&rsquo;s even in Sports Illustrated&rsquo;s 2015 Swimsuit Issue. She&rsquo;s a giant.</p>
		<p>And Zingano&rsquo;s longshot journey, from wrestling at Boulder&rsquo;s Fairview High School to earning a UFC title shot, has been both rocky and &ldquo;Rocky.&rdquo; In her corner on fight night, she will have two coaches and two close friends. But the one man she wanted most in her corner won&rsquo;t be, and it&rsquo;s one reason she&rsquo;s crumbling in the corner of a locker room this January night.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I have to break,&rdquo; Zingano said. &ldquo;But I won&rsquo;t stay broken.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Mauricio Zingano gave her a quick kiss and a bro hug. It&rsquo;ll be a massacre. No mascara here. Cat&rsquo;s husband, his shaved head bobbing to the beat of pre-fight music, stood behind her while the cut man lathered Vaseline on her face.</p>
		<p>An accomplished Brazilian jiu jitsu coach, Mauricio guided Cat&rsquo;s transformation from wrestler to mixed martial artist out of the gym they co-owned in Broomfield. Now, on April 13, 2013, they&rsquo;re in the spotlight at the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas for her biggest fight yet, against Miesha Tate.</p>
		<p>As she walked into the frenzied venue, leading her team&rsquo;s procession to the cage, Zingano started sobbing. A national TV audience tweeted about her tears. Crying before a fight? They must have wondered if Zingano was in over her head.</p>
		<p>But she&rsquo;s unabashedly emotional. Raw and real.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, it&rsquo;s about to start,&rsquo; Zingano said of her pre-fight swing of emotions. &ldquo;But once that door is closed and you&rsquo;re in there, it&rsquo;s like, &lsquo; Screw it, you&rsquo;ve gotta go, now.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But when the cage door closes behind you, you&rsquo;re all alone.</p>

		</div>

		<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, stud!&rdquo; Zingano&rsquo;s coach, Leister Bowling, hollered to Brayden Zingano.</p>
		<p>An hour before her Jan. 14 breakdown, Cat unassumingly entered MusclePharm gym in the Montbello neighborhood of Denver, greeted by a family of fighters of all shapes and sizes, many with cauliflower ears, tattoos crawling down their arms and T-shirts screaming outrageous mantras (&ldquo;FIGHTING IS IN MY DNA&rdquo;).</p>
		<p>She was the only athlete on the mats who brought a child, her bubbly son Brayden, 8. Within minutes, Brayden climbed inside the black-wired Octagon, playfully sparring with a professional fighter twice his height. The boy sported fighting gloves so oversized they would&rsquo;ve been more suited for his dad. </p>
		<p>At MusclePharm, it&rsquo;s as if everyone is Brayden&rsquo;s fun uncle. That&rsquo;s not a stretch.</p>
		<p>Soon, Brayden was swinging on nearby gymnast rings as a sparring partner slammed his mom around a cage. It was ugly. When Cat&rsquo;s four five-minute practice rounds ended, she escaped to the women&rsquo;s locker room.</p>
		<p>About 45 minutes later, she emerged and sat on a bench near the Octagon, her eyes weathered and red and impenetrable. A jovial visitor tried to get her to loosen up, but she wasn&rsquo;t going to let an outsider see inside. Cat&rsquo;s friend and fellow fighter, Brandon Thatch, began rubbing her shoulders.</p>
		<p>&rdquo;I love you, you know we all love you,&ldquo; he told her. </p>
		<p>Love. This word grapples the fighter.</p>
		<p>She knows how to love. Her son is her life, and she loves her sport and her support group. She also knows how to love hate. She embraces the vitriol necessary to make a  woman’s face the color of an eggplant. But love took her for a ride.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;When it all comes down to it, he had my heart, all wrapped up,&rdquo; Zingano said  recently, while Sam Smith&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB-5XG-DbAA">&ldquo;Stay With Me&rdquo;</a> played faintly in the background at the gym. &ldquo;I never felt like that about anybody. And I don&rsquo;t imagine feeling like that about anybody again.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Miesha Tate waited for Cat that April 2013 night in Vegas as Mauricio peered into the Octagon. Tate, a former champion in the Strikeforce series. Tate, an overwhelming favorite.</p>
		<p>And there was more on the line than a shiny belt. Zingano vs. Tate was an elimination bout; the winner would earn a title shot against Rousey. It would be the first UFC women&rsquo;s championship. It also meant a fat TV contract to coach a team in season 18 of &ldquo;The Ultimate Fighter,&rdquo; the UFC&rsquo;s reality TV competition show.</p>
		<p>One  woman would get a career break. So who would break first?</p>
		<p>Tate sprinted out when the horn sounded, grabbed Zingano around the waist and, just five seconds in, slammed Cat to the mat.</p>
		<p>With her back flat under Tate&rsquo;s barrage, Zingano wriggled away. She slipped a perfect escape to regain her feet. Within a minute, Zingano gained control, and folded Tate&rsquo;s head under the crook of her elbow, working toward a guillotine choke, with all her leverage in the legs, a tenet of wrestling.</p>

		</div>

		<p>She was the only girl on the boy&rsquo;s team.  At Fairview High, Zingano &mdash; then Cathilee Albert &mdash; wrestled at 130 and 135 pounds. Her parents hated the idea.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I identified with it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I loved it.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>She devoured the sport. In the offseason, she showed up at gyms looking to learn. She pushed her way into a practice session at nearby Lyons High, where some of the best prep wrestlers were working out. She wanted to wrestle the best.</p>
		<p>Leister Bowling, on his way to becoming a three-time Colorado champion, was already well-known in wrestling circles. And he didn&rsquo;t want Zingano anywhere near his mat. This was a boy&rsquo;s club. In a practice session, he intentionally shattered her cheekbone.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He tried to make me quit all the time,&rdquo; Zingano said of the wrestler who, sure enough, would one day become one of her coaches. &ldquo;They were like: &lsquo;Oh, this chick thinks she&rsquo;s going to go with us? She&rsquo;s never going to wrestle again after this.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Cat came back the next day.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I got beat up a lot,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it made me really tough.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Wrestling defined Zingano. It guided her through high school, it propelled her to college, it allowed her to dream. She wanted a shot at the 2004 U.S. women&rsquo;s Olympic team.</p>
		<p>But when Cat was a freshman at Cumberland (Tenn.) College, one of her closest friends back home, 17-year-old Mary Rogers, was found tortured and killed in Westminster. Rogers&rsquo; boyfriend was later convicted of first-degree murder.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like I recovered from that,&rdquo; Zingano said of her time in college in the early 2000s. &ldquo;She was one of my best friends since I was 8 years old. It was really traumatic. Now I look back, and I just feel &mdash; a lot of my drive for what I wanted to do with wrestling was smoldered by that.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Back in Colorado in 2007, and a new mother, Cat walked into Zingano’s Brazilian jiu jitsu gym in Broomfield and discovered a new challenge.</p>
		<p>It was love at first fight.</p>
		<p>Cat entered the gym and there was this instructor, Mauricio. </p>
		<p>&ldquo;I was in awe of him, how strong he was, how talented he was,&rdquo; Cat said of Mauricio, twice a national Brazilian jiu jitsu champ. &ldquo;The presence he carried, he was just so bold and impressive. And he really made me laugh a lot.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He suggested she take a jiu jitsu class. She promptly fell in love &mdash; with the sport and the instructor. </p>
		<p>On a gym trip to Water World, Cat recalled in a soft voice, &ldquo;He held my hand.&rdquo; Though she was wary of dating her coach, these feelings were new and raw and exciting.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Finally, I went back to a class,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And he said, &ldquo;All right, you and me are (sparring)!&rsquo; After class, he pulled me aside, and we were connected at the hip after. Always, forever.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;At first, it was perfect. I was so gung-ho on impressing him, being his prodigy, winning every tournament. Everything I did, I wanted to keep handing him trophies: &lsquo;This is for you. I won this.&rsquo; I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t do any wrong. And he was so proud of me.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They became addicted. Addicted to each other. Addicted to success. Work hard, fight hard, win hard. But the dynamic was toxic. Her boyfriend, whom she married in 2010, was her coach, too. And her business partner running multiple gyms. Oh, and they were parents.</p>
		<p>Her husband saw greatness in her fists, and constantly challenged her to eat certain foods, to go for an extra run at night, to learn from criticism. It all became too much.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know who I was talking to,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had so much respect for him, I would never say anything. I would look at him as my coach and my boss, but I needed to be able to talk to him like my husband.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There was depression,&rdquo; she said of Mauricio. &ldquo;I feel like we would&rsquo;ve figured it out eventually, but he made some bad choices to make things worse, and I couldn&rsquo;t put up with it and have my son around it. I had to do something, but I didn&rsquo;t know what to do. </p>
		<p>&ldquo;So I left him.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Tate wriggled out of the guillotine. She flung a rigid jab that landed on Zingano&rsquo;s chin, stunning Cat and backing her to the cage. Tate would land 23 significant strikes in the fight, 21 at Zingano&rsquo;s head.</p>
		<p>But she weathered Tate’s blows and grew more aggressive as the bout wore on. This is her great trait: Hit me and I&rsquo;ll hit you harder.</p>
		<p>Professional prize fighting is a little like trying to solve a math equation while someone pitches baseballs at your face. In order to survive, let alone be successful, fighters have to keep their wits under extreme stress, in order to perform a set of specific, directed movements. </p>
		<p>More than other sports, the fight game is about mastering your own body.</p>
		<p>Zingano&rsquo;s introduction to MMA was brutal. It was a lesson, if you want to call it that, from Mauricio. He told her she&rsquo;d be a champion one day, but it would be earned.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He stood me in the corner of a boxing ring and just tee&rsquo;d off on me &mdash; on my face, everything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He was trying to teach me to not turn when I was being hit. Because I don&rsquo;t like getting hit, like a regular human. I would be crying, bawling. He had another student doing it to me too. And then they would tell me when to shoot &mdash; and I would go for a takedown right away so they&rsquo;d stop hitting me.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I yelled, &lsquo;Stop hitting me!&rsquo; It happens every fight. Nobody likes getting hit. I don&rsquo;t. But when somebody gets a good one off on me, it makes me really mad. I just want to make it stop. I want to punish them.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Tate was about to be punished.</p>

		<p>Now living apart and in marriage counseling, the Zinganos agreed to meet at the play area at FlatIron Crossing mall in Broomfield. It was January 2014. They could share some quality Brayden time. A chance to be a family again.</p>
		<p>Mauricio never showed.</p>
		<p>Cat called. She called again. Mauricio never missed a meetup with Brayden. She called again. <i>Where is this guy?</i> She drove to his home, saw his car out front. </p>
		<p>&ldquo;I was afraid to go in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because I didn&rsquo;t know what that meant I was going to find.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Each time she dialed his number, deep into the night, there was a simultaneous feeling of hope and hopelessness. <i>Just answer and everything will be all right, won&rsquo;t it?</i></p>
		<p>The following day, she asked one of their jiu jitsu students to go by Mauricio&rsquo;s home. But the student never called Cat back. So Cat finally went to the house. </p>
		<p>Cop cars. </p>
		<p><i>What did he do? Did he have a dispute with the student?</i></p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are you Cat?&rdquo; a detective asked her.</p>
		<p>She didn&rsquo;t know what to say. Should she call a lawyer? Mauricio always said to opt for a lawyer instead of talking to cops.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I can only tell you what happened if you’re Cat,&rdquo; the detective said.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;m Cat.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Looking back at that moment, Cat recalled how she didn&rsquo;t realize she was screaming, as if she wasn&rsquo;t in control of her body.</p>
		<p>But she was indeed screaming, incessantly, the same three words, over and over: &ldquo;WHAT THE (EXPLETIVE)?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Mauricio was dead. Suicide. Age 37.</p>

		<p>When she won the biggest fight of her life, Cat screamed, &ldquo;I love you Brayden!&ldquo; into a camera lens, while her husband lifted her like a trophy.</p>
		<p>Cat unleashed a primal scream and one final punch into the air, while Mauricio shouted, &ldsquo;No. 1!&rdquo; with his wife in his arms.</p>
		<p>Cat defeated Tate with a hard-to-watch sequence of four consecutive knees to the face. Cat held Tate&rsquo;s head in a vice move the whole time. Fight over. TKO 2:55, third round.</p>
		<p>It was all falling into place.</p>
		<p>But one month later, right before the May 2013 filming began for &ldquo;The Ultimate Fighter,&rdquo; Cat tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee. Cat’s title shot with Rousey was canceled. The UFC replaced her with, of all people, Tate.</p>
		<p>And Mauricio&rsquo;s downward spiral began.</p>

		<p>How do you tell a boy his dad is dead?</p>
		<p>Cat opened the bedroom door that 2014 night, and there was her innocent child, oblivious in bed. </p>
		<p>&ldquo;I got home that night,&rdquo; Cat said, uncharacteristically clearing her throat, &ldquo;and Brayden was asleep. I had to wake him up. I feel like every catastrophe in our lives you remember exactly where you were, what you were doing, who you were with, almost down to what you were wearing. I get one shot at this.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The detective told her to speak definitively, to avoid ambiguity. Trying to soften the moment only makes it worse. </p>
		<p>He&rsquo;s dead. Gone. Dad is gone.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she recalled, &ldquo;was the hardest thing I&rsquo;ve ever done in my life.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>How do you teach a boy to cope with death, when you don&rsquo;t know either?</p>
		<p>Cat and Brayden often visit <a href="http://www.judishouse.org/">Judi&rsquo;s House</a>, to meet with a group of people who also lost a loved one to suicide. Founded by former Broncos quarterback Brian Griese, who lost his mother when he was 12, Judi&rsquo;s House is a haven for grieving kids who lost a parent, so they don&rsquo;t have to feel alone.</p>
		<p>Alone. A haunting theme in Cat&rsquo;s life, too. Alone in the ring. Alone as a parent. Alone as a wife. A widow. She&rsquo;s often surrounded &mdash; by fans and coaches and Brayden and friends &mdash; but she can&rsquo;t always cover herself from emotions. They&rsquo;re undefeated. Emotions send her into the corner of the locker room, where she has to hide.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Catch me any time of the day, I&rsquo;m either pissed at him, happy with him, in love with him, mad at him,&rdquo; Cat said of Mauricio, who she still refers to as &ldquo;my husband&rdquo; in conversations. </p>
		<p>&ldquo;I want to go and accomplish and get all of this (fighting success) for us, and everything that we&rsquo;ve done, and all the work we&rsquo;ve put into it. He lost his damn mind. And that sucks, because he was a very strong, very smart, very intense and awesome person. But those things, mixed with a crazy ego, destroyed him. It&rsquo;s bittersweet.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;For my son to lose his dad and in that kind of way, I don&rsquo;t know how to put this, but &mdash; I don&rsquo;t want to quit, because I don&rsquo;t want that to be embedded in him from more than one angle.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>Now Brayden is hiding. It&rsquo;s a February night at MusclePharm gym, and he&rsquo;s crouching inside a giant tractor tire, the kind they make weight-lifters turn over and over as a cruel drill. He&rsquo;s playing hide-and-seek. A woman looks for him, and soon other fighters join in the playful search.</p>
		<p>The obvious hiding spot is under the cage, where his mom, in padded headgear, is sparring through a training session. After recovering from the knee injury, Cat finally got her shot at Rousey &mdash; a chance to bloody the female face of the UFC on the last day of February.</p>
		<p>The cage at MusclePharm gym is really a stage, and underneath is a space a few feet high, covered by a curtain. Someone flips up the curtain &mdash; <i>he&rsquo;s gotta be under here, right?</i> &mdash; but he&rsquo;s not. Where did Brayden go?</p>
		<p>Finally, he pops out of the giant tire, and he flashes a mischievous smile. </p>
		<p>This gym, this community, is his comfort zone. Mom&rsquo;s too. Here, you can be alone in the tire, or alone in the cage, but you never really are alone. </p>
		<p>&ldquo;To be honest,&rdquo; Cat said, &ldquo;I think part of the connection with Brayden and all of my teammates is that every fighter &mdash; some will tell you about it, some won&rsquo;t &mdash; has gone through hell at some point in their life.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;With Brayden, they all know what happened, and they see a kid that is going through something &mdash; and whatever color it is of what they&rsquo;ve gone through, they can identify with him, and they want to be there for him. It&rsquo;s really sweet. And it&rsquo;s really cool and comforting.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know a single fighter who doesn&rsquo;t have some kind of pain that they&rsquo;ve dealt with.&rdquo;</p>
